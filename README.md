# My Flask App

## demo Flask application
This is a demo Flask application

I used https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-flask-project.html to create an initial Flask app.

During creation, I chose (in the PyCharm ) to create a new virtual-env.

After creation, in PyCharm I selected 'Share project on Github' - this created a Github project, to which I commit and push every change.

## Run my app in local development mode
On my local machine I use the PyCharm "Run" (Shift+F10) to run the (development mode) web server inside PyCharm environment.

Then I open a Browser and browse to `localhost:5000` 

## Run my app from a terminal window


## Deploy my app to PythonAnywhere

TBD
